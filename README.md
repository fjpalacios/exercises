#Exercises

This is a repository of solved exercises to practice in several languages.

This repository is organized by folders, each folder is a different language, and within each of these folders you can find the practice files for each of the languages.

If any of these exercises are taken from a book or some website its respective authors will be credited in a comment at the beginning of the file.

This repository only contains some practices to improve my skills and I do not think this can be too interesting for anyone, but if you need them, they are licensed under the MIT License, i.e: you can do whatever you want with these files whenever share them with the same license and with the copyright notice.
